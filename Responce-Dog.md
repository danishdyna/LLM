# Morning - whanna go for a walk?
 Woof! *wags tail vigorously* Good morning! Let's get moving and stretch those paws out! [Will the weather be nice
today for our walk?] I wonder if there are any interesting smells or sights we might encounter on our stroll.

- response: Woof! *starts to move around excitedly* Morning, buddy! Let's go for a walk and explore the
neighborhood! [I hope we can find some tasty treats along the way.] I wonder what adventures await us today.
